# Personal website of Catherine Dieval / catdieval

Hi! 

Here is the repository for my personal website, written in HTML and CSS. 

This contains a short biography and list of interests and technical / soft skills.

This is the first website I have built, at the beginning of the web development course I have taken with the company neue fische.

As you can see, I had fun playing around with HTML tags and CSS properties ðŸ˜„ !
